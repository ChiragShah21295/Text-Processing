# Text-Processing
Text Processing means it will convert the wrong sentences into the correct sentence and automatically correct the grammar of sentences.
I have used the gingerit, language-check and grammar-check library for text processing.<br><br>
If we use gingerit library then if we input the speech like “rom” instead of “room” then it will automatically convert “rom” into  “room”.<br><br>
If we use language-check or grammar-check then if we input speech like “This are bad” then it will automatically convert into the sentence “These are bad”.<br><br>
I also bold the important words in the sentences.For example timing words like “there is meeting at 9:00 A.M” then it will bold the "9:00 A.M"<br><br>
I also convert the sentences into the greetings sentences.Like if we input the speech like “good morning” then it will convert the sentence into “Good morning!!”
